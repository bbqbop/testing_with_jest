# Testing with Jest

This Odin Project assignment aims to practice writing tests for your functions. In this little example of Test Driven Development practice I wrote tests for :

- capitalize(string), that returns a string with an uppercased first letter. 

- calculator, an object that contains 4 simple arithmetic functions, 

- caesarsCipher(string, x), that enciphers the given string by shifting every letter x amount through the alphabet.

- analzeArray(array), that returns an object with the properties average, min, max and length of the given array

and wrote the functions afterwards to pass the given tests.
